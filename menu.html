                        <li>1 tablespoon thyme</li>
                        <div>
                        <h3>Notes on the ingredients</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You can use only drumsticks or chicken breast.</li>
                            <li>You can use rooster or cockerel (male chicken) but hen (female chicken) tastes better.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                        <h3>Before you prepare Mixed Vegetables Jollof Rice</h3>
                        <p><li>
                            Prepare the tomato stew. Visit the Tomato Stew page for details on how to do that. 
                            It is advisable to prepare tomato stew before hand and keep in the freezer. This is so 
                            that whenever you want to cook any jollof rice related dish, it is just a matter of 
                            adding it to your cooking.
                        </li></p>
                        <p><li>
                            If you will use whole chicken then wash and cut it into pieces. Cook with the thyme, 
                            Knorr cubes and 2 bulbs of onions (chopped). The cooking time depends on the type of 
                            chicken. The rooster or cockerel cooks much faster than the hen but the hen is definitely 
                             tastier. When done, grill it in an oven. You may also fry it. This is to give it a golden 
                            look which is more presentable especially if you have guests for dinner.
                        </li></p>
                        <p><li>
                            Parboil the rice using the method detailed in parboiling rice for cooking jollof rice. 
                            Rinse the parboiled rice and put in a sieve to drain.
                        </li></p>
                        <h3>Cooking Directions</h3>
                        <p>Follow the cooking directions for the classic Nigerian Jollof Rice till Step 3.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When the water is almost dry, add the diced carrots, cover the pot and continue cooking.</li>
                            <li>When the water is completely dry, turn off the heat. Add the diced green 
                                pepper and stir the rice with a wooden spoon.</li>
                        </ul>        
            <p>Why can't we add the green pepper when we added the carrots? This is because 
                green pepper is a soft vegetable so even the slightest heat is enough to get it done. 
                If added at the same time as the carrots (which are harder) they will become dull and 
                unappetizing by the time the water is completely dry. So to keep the green pepper green and 
                looking fresh, we need to add them when we have turned off the heat.</p>
            <p>Do you see the change in your Jollof Rice? This we achieved by adding just 2 vegetables. 
                Isn't it interesting?</p>
